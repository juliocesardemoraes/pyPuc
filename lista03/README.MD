Django User Creation Project

This README provides instructions on how to run a Django project that focuses on creating users. It assumes you have a basic understanding of Django and have Python and Django installed on your system.
Setup

    Clone the repository to your local machine:

    bash

git clone <repository_url>

Change into the project directory:

bash

cd django-user-creation-project

Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash

python3 -m venv env

Activate the virtual environment:

    For Windows:

    bash

env\Scripts\activate

For macOS and Linux:

bash

    source env/bin/activate

Install the project dependencies:

bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration

    Open the settings.py file located in the project's directory.

    Configure the database settings:

    By default, the project is configured to use SQLite. If you prefer to use a different database, modify the DATABASES dictionary with the appropriate settings.

    Set up email settings (optional):

    If you want to enable email notifications for user registration, configure the EMAIL_BACKEND, EMAIL_HOST, EMAIL_PORT, EMAIL_HOST_USER, EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD, and EMAIL_USE_TLS settings in settings.py. Ensure that you have valid SMTP credentials for sending emails.

Database Setup

    Run the following command to create the necessary database tables:

    bash

python manage.py migrate

(Optional) If you want to create a superuser (admin) account, use the following command and follow the prompts:

bash

    python manage.py createsuperuser

Running the Server

    Start the development server:

    bash

    python manage.py runserver

    Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 (or the specified port if you modified the runserver command).

Usage

    Register a new user:
        Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/register.
        Fill in the required fields, such as username, email, and password.
        Click the "Register" button.
        If registration is successful, you will be redirected to the login page.

    Log in as a user:
        Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000/login.
        Enter your credentials (username and password).
        Click the "Log In" button.
        If login is successful, you will be redirected to the home page or a designated success page.

    Manage users (admin only):
        If you created a superuser account in the "Database Setup" section, you can access the Django admin panel by navigating to http://localhost:8000/admin.
        Log in using your superuser credentials.
        From the admin panel, you can manage users, including creating, editing, and deleting user accounts.

    User-related features:
        Depending on the project's implementation, there may be additional features related to user management, such as password reset, email verification, profile updates, etc. Refer to the project documentation or explore the application's interface for more details.
